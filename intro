The leadership academy handbook - guidelines for technical excellence in a decentralised organisation.

NASA has defined four guiding principles for Technical Excellence:<br>
- Clearly Documented Policies and Procedures
- Effective Training and Development
- Engineering Excellence
- Continuous Communications
    
They also defined two sets of roles and capabilities in the pursuit of Technical Excellence:<br>
- Personal accountability — each individual must believe that they are responsible for the success of the mission
- Organizational responsibility — provide the proper training, tools and environment
    
Combining the wisdom of the quoted articles we can say that technical excellence means 
continuously learning, striving for quality, being open for new ideas and willing to try out new approaches. 
Personal commitment is important, but what matters most is organizational commitment — 
nurturing the right environment and culture that supports learning and knowledge sharing.
